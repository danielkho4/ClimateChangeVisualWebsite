		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>For our project, we wanted to do something that involved the environment. At a very politically tense time we feel it is necessary to promote climate change awareness and allow viewers to figure out for themselves how our planet is changing. We looked through a few different visualization designs and came to the realization that stack area was optimal for our data. When we think of water, measuring and comparing, the stack area chart makes the most sense. We can view total precipitation of all the countries with the basic page, this allows the viewer to see trendlines and patterns in global totals but also comparisons between countries. The area of each stack is another characteristic that the eye naturally follows. When the user clicks on the country, the specific water measurements show up and the differences between each year is what we wanted to have the viewer focus on. Our simple visualization is not story but rather a puzzle where there is no narrative. Questions and answers have to be thought of by the user. Our main goal is to inform how precipitation between different years fluctuate between countries. Looking back, we underestimated how hard it would be to find clean and important data. On the Brightside we managed to use our labs to edit and tailor our visualization towards a specific goal.
			<p></p>
			In our homework process, we struggled a lot with finding clean and suitable data. We tried scoping through different environmental data, whether it be water waste levels, treated water levels, fresh water abstracted 	and so on. A lot of countries and years either do not record their data or report it to the UN. The data also had to be relevant to what we thought is important and rudimentary for climate change. Having a visualization for a niche and unrecognizable measurement would not be important for the basic viewer to look at. It was hard to find consistent clean data for every year for many countries. Once we have that data it needs to be optimized to fit loops that we are used to iterating through. We had to recreate and download our precipitation data many times in order to fit the chart properly. We had to utilize a pivot table to read data by year rather than by country to get it into a suitable csv format for our stack chart. Then we had to look through each country and eliminate ones that did not record suitable amounts of data. Other things we struggled on is add interactions that we have not done before. The resources we had were many but our capability to implement them was very small. We did manage to add a button which you used to view this informa

			<p>For the most part we worked on the process equally in each facet of the project. We mutually decided on a dataset after a lot of research and sat down and worked on the code together after figuring out our strategy.</p>
